# workopia-v2
Workopia is a simple job listing site I built back in 2024 to help people find and manage job posts. I used PHP and kept things clean by applying MVC, the Repository pattern, and a Container setup. To keep the code straightforward, I used manual routing instead of a full framework.

The site includes the core features you'd expect—creating, editing, and deleting job listings. Each user can only manage the jobs they created, and I’ve also added CSRF protection to make it more secure. It’s a lightweight project that focuses on the essentials, and I built it to learn and apply solid architecture without overcomplicating things.
